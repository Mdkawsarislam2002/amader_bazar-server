-   The description of the product should be displayed below the name.
-   The price of the product should be displayed below the description.
-   The discount and price after discount should be displayed below the price.
-   The image carousel should be placed below the price and discount.
-   The navigation arrows for the carousel should be placed on either side of the carousel.

3. Product Actions:

-   The Add to Cart, Add to Favorites, and Buy Now buttons should be placed below the image carousel.
-   The buttons should be displayed in a prominent color to make them easily visible to the user.

4. Reviews and Ratings:

-   The average rating and number of reviews should be displayed in a large font at the top of the section.
-   The Write a Review button should be placed below the rating and number of reviews.
-   The reviews should be displayed in a list format with the most recent review at the top.

5. Related Products:

-   The related products should be displayed in a grid format with their images, names, and prices.

By following these guidelines, we can create a UI that is easy to navigate and provides all the necessary information about the product.
